## Introduction

The Library Management System is designed to help libraries manage their operations efficiently, from adding books to managing users and borrowing/returning books. The application is built with a Node.js backend, Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL database, and uses Sequelize for ORM. It includes features for managing books, authors, categories, and users with user roles, and allows tracking borrowing and returning history. It supports a clean, responsive user interface built using Next.js.

## Key Features

The project offers the following key features:

-   **Book Management**: Add, update, view, and delete books; track book availability and borrowing status.
-   **Author Management**: Manage author information including name, bio, and books written.
-   **Category Management**: Classify books into categories for easy browsing and search.
-   **User Management**: Add and manage users with different roles (Admin, User), update user details, and track borrowing history.
-   **Borrowing System**: Allow users to borrow, return, and renew books.
-   **Book Availability Tracking**: Track the status of each book (available, borrowed, reserved).

## System Overview

The system is built using a modern stack of technologies for both frontend and backend:

-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
-   **Frontend**: Next.js (React-based framework)
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL
-   **API Testing**: Postman, Jest Framework
-   **ORM**: Sequelize
-   **Environment Management**: Dotenv

The system architecture is a monolithic design with a separation between frontend and backend services.

## Installation Guide

### Requirements
Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following tools installed:

-   [Docker-Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
-   [Docker-Compose-Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
-   [Node.js (LTS) Installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
-   [Git Installation](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [PostgreSQL Installation](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pchihieuu/library-management.git
cd library-management
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to both the backend and frontend directories and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
pnpm install
```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a .env file in the root directory and add your PostgreSQL configuration:

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=YOUR_PG_USER
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_PG_PASSWORD
DB_NAME=YOUR_DB_NAME
```

3. **Run Database Migrations**: Make sure PostgreSQL is running and execute migrations to set up the database:

```bash
cd backend
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

4. **Build and Run the Application**: You can now build and run both the backend and frontend:

```bash
# Build the backend
npm run build
# Run the backend
npm start

cd frontend
npm run build
npm start
```

5. **Docker Setup**: To run the application using Docker, follow these steps:
Set up environment variables in the .env file as mentioned above.
Run the application with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The backend will be available at http://localhost:5000, and the frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.
